# Supervised Learning
## Project: Analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

you are required to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

The jupyter notebook files for the project are `ydaba3_income_census.ipynb` & `ydaba3_breast_cancer.ipynb`.

You'll also find `visuals.py` python file for some of the graph plots that you'll require. 

NOTE : If you want to run the notebooks, Please run the notebook code in cell by cell ( from top to down one by one)


### How to Run

Download the project folder and navigate it via jupyter notebook or look at the codes here in github under the link : https://github.com/tyonas9/Project1

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `project1/` (that contains this README) by unzipping the file and run one of the following commands:

For the income census project 
```bash
ipython notebook ydaba3_income_census.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook ydaba3_income_census.ipynb
```
For the breast cancer project 
```bash
ipython notebook ydaba3_breast_cancer.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook ydaba3_breast_cancer.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.


### Dataset
There are two datasets included in this project, `census.csv` for the income census project and `breast_cancer.csv` for the breast cancer project
